This system is made using pure java. 

To run the code run cmd and navigate(cd) to the program file..,e.g C:\\Desktop\interview_code_test>

(assuming JDK is pre installed)
type in Javac kopokopoTx.java
after that runs 
type java kopokopoTx

Remember to repeat this steps in CMD when you change the CSV file in code.

All csv files are initialised in the code that is

static String file = "test_data/transaction_data_1.csv";
static String file1 = "test_data/transaction_data_2.csv";
static String file2 = "test_data/transaction_data_3.csv";

To run a different csv file simply change file name here
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("new file here"))) e.g file1 or file 2
